<h2>Experiment Overview</h2>

<p>
In this experiment, you will be working with node-link visualizations of brain connectivity datasets to complete certain graph tasks. Each dataset in this experiment contains 18 vertice and 25 edges, and each edge has two attributes: <i>strength</i> and <i>certainty</i>. Each attribute can take any integer value between 1 and 5 (inclusive). Each visualization encodes the two attributes using two different visual channels (e.g. hue, brightness, or width) of the edges. In each trial, you will be asked to <b>make visual judgements about one of the two attributes while trying your best to not be distracted by the other attribute</b>.
<p>
<p>
There will be twelve blocks of tasks. The visual channels used in the visualizations will change across blocks. At the beginning of each block, you will be shown the legends of the visual encodings used in that block, as well as hints that might help you interpret the visual encodings. There are two types of tasks for each block: visual search tasks and comparison tasks. There is <b>no guarantee which type of tasks will appear first for each block</b>. There will be a 20-second break between each block of tasks. You won't be able to proceed before the 20 seconds is up, but you can take a longer break if you would like to. You can also take breaks between individual trials if needed.
</p>

<h4>Visual Search Task Instruction</h4>

<p>
In this task, you will be asked to judge <b>whether edges with certain attribute values are present in each trial.</b>. 
</p>
<p>
In each trial, you will first see the characteristics of the target edges (e.g. "Strength = 5") and a legend for strength levels and certainty levels. You will see the label "[VS]" before the target, indicating that this is a visual search task. Please 
familiarize yourself with the legend and the characteristics of the targets before you continue; there is no time limit for this step. 
</p>
<p>
Once you are ready, press "Enter", and you will see a network graph. You will have <b>5 seconds</b> to search for the targets before the graph disappears. When time is up, a "Response" screen will appear. Press "1" if you think the target is present in the previous network graph. Press "2" if you think the target is missing in the previous network graph. Your response will be displayed on the screen as "Present" or "Missing". You can change your response as long as you are still on the "Response" screen. When you are ready to submit your response, press "Enter" to continue to the next trial.

<h4>Comparison Task Instruction</h4>

<p>
In this task, you will see two graph visualizations of two different datasets in each trial. You will be asked to 
<b>choose which datasets have either higher overall strength or higher overall certainty</b>. A graph <b>has higher overall 
strength(certainty) if the sum of the strength(certainty) of all the edges in the graph is higher</b>.
</p>
<p>
In each trial, you will first see the target attribute upon which you are asked to make the decision (e.g. "Certainty") and a legend for strength levels and certainty levels. You will see the label "[CP]" before the target, indicating that this is a comparison task. Please familiarize yourself with the legend and the target attribute before you continue; there is no time limit for this step. 
</p>
<p>
Once you are ready, press "Enter", and you will see two network graphs. You will have <b>3 seconds</b> to compare the two graphs before the graphs disappear. When time is up, a "Response" screen will appear. Press "1" if you think the graph on the left has higher overall target attribute. Press "2" if you think the graph on the right has higher overall target attribute. Your response will be displayed on the screen as "Left" or "Right". You can change your response as long as you are still on the "Response" screen. When you are ready to submit your response, press "Enter" to continue to the next trial.
</p>
<p>
The two datasets in the same trial will always have different overall strength(certainty).

</p>

<h4>Reading the legend</h4>

<p>
In the legend, the top five lines illustrate the visual encodings for the five different levels of strength, and the bottom five lines illustrate the visual encodings for the five different levels of certainty. Therefore, the <b>top five lines encode the same certainty level (certainty = 5), and the bottom five lines encode the same strength level (strength = 5)</b>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note that you will not be looking for exact matches with the legends. </b> For example, if the target condition is "strength = 5", then an edge with level 5 strength and level 3 certainty will be a target, but it will not look the same as the edge with level 5 strength in the legend.
