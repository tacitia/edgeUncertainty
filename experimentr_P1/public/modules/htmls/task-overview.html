<h2>Experiment Overview</h2>

<p>
In this experiment, you will be working with node-link visualizations of brain connectivity datasets to complete certain graph tasks. Each dataset in this experiment contains 18 nodes and 25 edges, and each edge has two attributes: <i>strength</i> and <i>certainty</i>. Each attribute can take any integer value between 1 and 5 (inclusive). A higher strength value indicates a stronger connection. A higher certainty value indicates a connection with more consistent measurements from multiple sources.
<p>
<p>
There will be twelve blocks of tasks. There are two types of tasks for each block: visual search tasks and comparison tasks. There is <b>no guarantee which type of tasks will appear first for each block</b>. There will be a 30-second break between each block of tasks. You won't be able to proceed before the 30 seconds is up, but you can take a longer break if you would like to. You can also take breaks between individual trials if needed.
</p>

<h4>Visual Search Task Instruction</h4>

<p>
In this task, you will be asked to find a set of target edges in each trial. You will be asked to <b>select all 
edges with either a given strength level or a given certainty level</b>. 
</p>
<p>
In each trial, you will first see the characteristics of the targets (e.g. "Strength = 5") and a legend for strength levels and certainty levels. You will see the label "[VS]" before the target, indicating that this is a visual search task. Please 
familiarize yourself with the legend and the characteristics of the targets before clicking on the "Show trial" button; there is no time limit for this step. 
</p>
<p>
Once the "Show trial" button is clicked, you will see a network graph. You will have <b>15 seconds</b> to complete the task before the graph disappears.
You can click on an edge to select it as a target. The end points of a selected edge will become red. 
You can click on a selected edge to cancel the selection.
</p>

<h4>Comparison Task Instruction</h4>

<p>
In this task, you will see two graph visualizations of two different datasets in each trial. You will be asked to 
<b>choose which datasets have either higher overall strength or higher overall certainty</b>. A graph <b>has higher overall 
strength(certainty) if the sum of the strength(certainty) of all the edges in the graph is higher</b>.
</p>
<p>
In each trial, you will first see the attribute upon which you are asked to make the decision (e.g. "Certainty") and a legend for strength levels and certainty levels. You will see the label "[CP]" before the target, indicating that this is a comparison task. Please familiarize yourself with the legend and the target attribute before clicking on the "Show trial" button; there is no time limit for this step. 
</p>
<p>
Once the "Show trial" button is clicked, you will see two network graphs. You will have <b>5 seconds</b> to complete the task before the graphs disappear.
You can click on the background of a graph to select it as a target. Clicking on edges or nodes will have no effect. A selected graph will have red borders. 
</p>
<p>
The two datasets in the same trial will always have different overall strength(certainty).

<h4>Reading the legend</h4>

<p>
In the legend, the top five lines illustrate the visual encodings for the five different levels of strength, and the bottom five lines illustrate the visual encodings for the five different levels of certainty. Therefore, the <b>top five lines encode the same certainty level (certainty = 5), and the bottom five lines encode the same strength level (strength = 5)</b>.
