<h2>Experiment Overview</h2>

<p>
In this experiment, you will be working with node-link visualizations of brain connectivity datasets. Each dataset in this experiment contains 18 nodes and 25 edges, and each edge has two attributes: <i>strength</i> and <i>certainty</i>. Each attribute can take any integer value between 1 and 5 (inclusive). A higher strength value indicates a stronger connection. A higher certainty value indicates a connection with more consistent measurements from multiple sources.
<p>
<p>
There will be two blocks of tasks. In the first block of tasks (visual search), you will be asked to find all the edges with certain strength or certainty. In the second block of tasks (comparison), you will be asked to choose the graph with higher overall strength or certainty. More details of each type of tasks will be provided later.
