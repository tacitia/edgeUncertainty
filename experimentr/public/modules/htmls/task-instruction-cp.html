<h2>Comparison Task Instruction</h2>

<p>
In this task, you will see two graph visualizations of two different datasets in each trial. You will be asked to 
choose which datasets have either higher overall strength or higher overall certainty. A graph has higher overall 
strength(certainty) if the sum of the strength(certainty) of all the edges in the graph is higher.
</p>
<p>
The target attribute will be displayed below the graphs in each trial. You can click on the background of a 
graph to select it as a target. Clicking on edges or nodes will have no effect. A selected graph will have red borders. 
</p>
<p>
The two datasets in the same trial will always have different overall strength(certainty).
